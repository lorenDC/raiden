## Docker-Compose commands to run Isolated ENV		
### To run the testing in an isolated environment, run docker-compose by executing the following cmd.		
  * Folder path: ..\raiden\product-registry		

1. To up the isolated env
```shell
  docker-compose up
```
2. To check running container/s	
```shell
  docker-compose ps	
```
3. To down the isolated env	
```shell
  ctrl+c to stop env
  docker-compose down
```	
* Once the environment is down, all data will be deleted

### Guidelines:		
- --env "isolated" *setup of isolated environment that runs in docker-compose*	
- --verbose	*To ease debugging, reports can also be generated for every step to display whether a step has been executed successfully. Such reports can be generated by using the --verbose flag. These reports are generated on the console*	
- --table-rows *you can set specific test case/s or run all the whole csv, ***not declaring --table-rows will run the whole csv file <testcases>*** BUT **SHOULD RUN THE SUCCESS SPEC FIRST** to create top level parent data to validate the existence of the blueprint.* 
- product-registry\gauge-integration\specs\features\create_features_declined.*spec relative file path*	

### Positive Testing Process Flow of Feature/Product Registration 	
* Folder Path: copy relative path of the preferred spec to test

Run the following cmd:		
```shell
	 gauge run --env "isolated" --verbose --table-rows "1-7" product-registry\gauge-integration\specs\features\create_features_success.spec	
```  
		
### Negative Testing Process Flow of Feature/Product Registration 		

Run the following cmd:	

1. Create a top level parent to validate the existence of the blueprint 

```shell
  gauge run --env "isolated" --verbose --table-rows "1-7" product-registry\gauge-integration\specs\features\create_features_success.spec	
```

2. Once test data was created. Run the ff. cmd

```shell
	gauge run --env "isolated" --verbose --table-rows "1-10" product-registry\gauge-integration\specs\features\create_features_declined.spec
```

**OTHER INFO**
1. Not advisable to run spec simultaneously.

Here's the estimated execution time per spec.

*Success Spec*

> Specifications: 1 executed      1 passed        0 failed        0 skipped
> Scenarios:      17 executed     17 passed       0 failed        0 skipped

> Total time taken: 7m43.377s

*Decline Spec*

> Specifications: 1 executed      1 passed        0 failed        0 skipped
> Scenarios:      50 executed     50 passed       0 failed        0 skipped

> Total time taken: 16m43.925s

2. Update CSV file to add/update testcase/s
